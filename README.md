## [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)

> Beautifully designed, privacy-focused, and packed with features. We care about your experience, not your data.

1. Install the browser
2. Go through the onboarding experience.
3. Type 'about:support' and enter.
4. Click 'Open Folder' beside the 'Profile Folder' option. It will redirect you to a folder with lots of stuff. Don't worry.
5. Create a 'chrome' folder (You shouldn't already have one if you're new, however if it's there, perfectly fine).
6. Copy the chrome content from the downloaded source code of my repo from releases, then paste it into your own chrome folder.
7. Go back to 'about:support' in the browser and click 'Clear Startup Cache'. It wil restart the browser with the new customization.
8. Install the [Zen Internet](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zen-internet/) extension. Open it and make it fetch the latest styles. This is the goated extension to make your websites look transparent
9. For the final touch, we will go to 'about:config'

### About:config settings

- `browser.tabs.allow_transparent_browser` = true

## [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi)

> A tiling window manager for Windows

This is not a simple app installation method. It is suggested that you follow the [documentation](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/), however, I can give you a much simpler way to install it here as reading the documentation takes time. Follow me along here:

1. Open Warp (considering you already installed it) or Powershell
2. Paste this command:
   `Set-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem' -Name 'LongPathsEnabled' -Value 1`
3. Then paste this one:
   `winget install LGUG2Z.komorebi
    winget install LGUG2Z.whkd`
4. Then paste this one:
   `komorebic quickstart`
You're done with the installation! Now you can use it as shown in the main video.
The default start command is `komorebic start --whkd --bar`, meaning, you need to type/autofill it everytime you want to enable komorebi. You can find hotkeys [here](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/example-configurations.html#whkdrc).


# Extras
> [!NOTE]
> These apps not necessarily follow the transparency theory, but they follow well with Microsoft's Fluent Design theory and look cool too. They are totally optional but I suggest doing them anyways.

## [Screenbox Media Player](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntsnmsvcb5l?hl=en-US&gl=US)

> Screenbox is a modern media player for all your devices, with support for a wide range of file formats.

It is a fork of the OG VLC Media Player. So you get features of VLC with a modern UI, nothing to lose here :smiley:

## [Melosik](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nh759pmh26m?hl=en-US&gl=US)

> Melosik is a beautiful, Modern and easy to use music player specially made for Modern Windows.

Local music players. Looks nice, Only minor downside is an ad popup in the top right, which is totally justified. Not like it interrupts the music experience in any way. Enable the acrylic body and header in Settings > Appearance.
